                My name is Jordan Schneider and I am a full fledged nerd aspiring to become a full stack web developer. I am currently a boot camper at UC Davis Extension's web development program in Sacramento, CA.
              </p>
                
              <p>
                I am fairly new to the tech sphere having only taught myself HTML, CSS, and some Javascript, but I am excited to see how this boot camp will push me to ascend new heights and learn more technologies. This journey has not always been easy and I constantly find myself feeling both capable and incapable at the same time. Hence, the coder's dilemma! However, there is a certain comfortability in being uncomfortable. This past year there were numerous times I went outside of my comfort zone, and it took me to places I would've never dreamed of; for seven weeks I traveled through the lands of Middle Earth (or is it called New Zealand?), a few months later I was living in the jungle along the Carribean in Northern Colombia, and before that I was going to salsa and bachata dance lessons twice a week, learning new moves and constantly making new friends. This boot camp is just a new landscape not yet ventured, and I can't wait to see what I discover.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not writing code and trying new things I don't totally understand, you can find me at home singing in my bathroom, simulating a DnD campaign in Divinity: Original Sin 2, or lifting weights at the gym. I am the youngest of six half-siblings and I have been an uncle since day one (I believe I am up to three nieces, five nephews, and one to be determined!). I like to think I am a fish out of water, as I have enjoyed professional swimming along with lifeguarding for around eight years. Finally, I am big fan of anime and manga; so much so that I have inked two images from my favorite series, One Piece, onto my right arm and shoulder.
              </p>
